I worked alone <br/>
This assignment is my own implementation of Debit and Credit, with changes in App.js, Credits.js, and Debits.js <br/>
A styling sheet made for Debits.js and Credits.js is also made <br/>
A note to self: Add the implementations in App.js and use the props methods in the child components so that values don't change and can be used globally<br/>
Also a lot of the commits were because of mistakes of not realizing I need two branches, a master and a git-pages branch, now the repository should be working well with github pages <br/>
